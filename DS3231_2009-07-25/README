This is a small extension board for the DS3231 and DS32kHz TCXO from
Maxim-IC. The footprint fits the SOIC-16 package of the chip. It has
pull-outs for all the pins of the DS3231 RTC, though special care has to be
taken if the same board is supposed to be used for the DS32kHz. In that
case, all the pins that are not used have to be wired up to the ground plain
in order to maximize power efficiency.

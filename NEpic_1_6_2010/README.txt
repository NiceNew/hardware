NEpic: NESL Epic Adapter Board
------------------------------

This is an adapter board for the Epic module
(http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/projects/epic/). It adds 3 LEDs, a
chip antenna, an Epic Miniprog port for programming, and a nice edge
connector for a Samtec plug. Whis makes the epic more universal and
reusable.

The Samtec connector that mates with the edge connector is the Samtec
MEC8-130 family. They have right-angle version of it such that the NEpic can
be stacked with a baseboard containing sensors and power supply options.

ENG_DWG: Engineering drawings including schematics and pcb for Altium
Designer.

TO_PCB: Gerber files to fab the board.
